# Robotic Walker - New Codebase

## Project steps

1. Define MADS-compliant [architecture](ARCHITECTURE.md): 
   1. identify the necessary and optional agents
   2. identify the list of devices
   3. create an **issue** on this project for each of the above
2. Implement code for embebbed systems (Arduino)
3. Implement **source** agents (or plugins)
4. Implement **filter** agents
5. Implement controller agent as an RT-timed state machine
6. Implement/adapt GUI (as a **sink** agent)

This action order ensures that each agent can be tested, debugged and timed before integrating into the next higher level agent.

## Repo layout

Each agent has its own repo. All repos are added to this main repo as **git sumbodules**, so that:

* each submodule has its own repo that is independent (i.e. can be developed, built and tested independently)
* cloning this repo also clones all the necessary submodules
* submodules versions are *synchronized*, i.e. their commit hashes are recorded in the main repo, and each tag version in the main repo keeps the list of proper submodules versions
* most of the code is kept private, but some submodules can still be left public or demanded to students work

This repo shall only contain documentation and links to submodules. Each submodule shall be self-contained and self-sufficient. The purpose of this repo is thus to collect all the necessary codebase in a single container, also providing a single access point to GitHub issues.

## GitHub stuff

Each module shall have a maintainer person. The module repo shall be under the maintainer GitHub account.

The [current organization](https://github.com/mmt-unitn) keeps **forks** of all modules. This main repo adds submodules via the forks URLs.

## Code etiquette

### Project management

Project management shall be performed with CMake tools.

Install and select clang as compiler:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install clang
sudo update-alternative
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/cc cc /usr/bin/clang 100
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/c++ c++ /usr/bin/clang++ 100
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/clang 100
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/clang++ 100
sudo update-alternatives --set cc /usr/bin/clang
sudo update-alternatives --set c++ /usr/bin/clang++
sudo update-alternatives --set gcc /usr/bin/clang
sudo update-alternatives --set g++ /usr/bin/clang++
```Â 

### Third party libraries

* Unless absolutely necessary, try to avoid the use of large/huge general purpose frameworks (as QT or boost).
* When available, prefer header-only libraries to compiled ones (e.g. use `eigen` rather than `armadillo`). This tipically means easier integration and porting.
* Unless for very common libraries (e.g. `libgzip`, `libcurl`, `libopenssl`), prefer a locally built library with standard version. Use CMake's `FetchContent` or, as a second choice, `ExternalProject`. In this way, any build uses exactly the same version of any external tool, and that version is tracked in the git repo.
* If possible, prefer static linking of libraries, so that the resulting code can be installed more easily.

### Coding

* Use 2 spaces for tabs.
* Use `TitleCase` for classes, namespaces, and global variables; use `snake_case` for variable and methods/functions; prepend an underscore to any `_private_attribute` (but not to `public_attributes`!); use `ALL_CAPS` for preprocessor macros.
* Install `clang-format` and regularly reformat the code with the default `clang-format` style (there is a VSCode extension for that).
* Mark each file with a comment header reporting purpose, author, creation date.

## Preemptive-RT scheduler

To attain the most reliable timing, configure the Raspbery Pi by enabling the Preemptive-RT scheduler in the kernel. Follow instructions [here](https://github.com/pbosetti/Raspberry5-RT).

## Remote development

Prefer setting up the Raspberry Pi without the GUI on boot (use `sudo raspi-config`).

To develop and compile, use VSCode with the *Remote Development* extension, connecting to the RPi via ssh.

On Linux and MacOS, the fastest way to connect the Raspberry Pi to the local computer is to set it up so that the USB-C connecting PC and Raspberry also tunnels an Ethernet connection. Follow instructions [here](https://gist.github.com/pbosetti/f5a539810f85ae17ab6eda0864e986b9). On Windows, use an Ethernet cross-cable or connect to a wired network (WiFi can make Remote Development laggy on some Raspi hardware).

Remember to setup Avahi on the Raspberry Pi.

To avoid typing the password at any connection, set up the public key authentication. On your computer, open a shell and:

```sh
cd ~
ssh-keygen -t rsa
# Assuming that user name is `user` and host name is `rpi.local`:
scp .ssh/id_rsa.pub user@rpi.local:
```

Authenticate to your Raspberry Pi on the last command. This copies the public key to the home folder on the Raspi. Then log into the raspi and:

```sh
# check is there is a .ssh folder in your root
# If not, do `ssh-keygen -t rsa`
cat id_rsa.pub >> .ssh/authorized_keys
rm id_ rsa.pub
```

Log out and log in again. The password should not be necessary.
